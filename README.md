**Interventions targeting the farm environment to control antimicrobial resistance: a mathematical modeling study of resistant Escherichia coli in cattle**

*Wendy Beauvais, Getahun E. Agga, Terrance Arthur, John W. Schmidt, Rachel Jennings, Renata Ivanek*

The objectives of this study were to use tetracycline-resistant *E. coli* in beef cattle as an exemplar to: (i) elucidate the role of the environment in the persistence of antimicrobial resistant enteric bacteria in farm environments; and (ii) test the hypothesis that generic hygiene measures such as scraping manure from pens more regularly can contribute to reducing the presence of antimicrobial resistant enteric bacteria in farm environments. 

*This study is currently under peer review.*
